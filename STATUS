Badges Requested

We have provided a detailed readme with our submission. It provides all the information to reproduce the data in the paper.
We have packed all the required software in a docker image, and we have hosted it on a Dockerhub to make it publicly available.
We have provided the link to the Github repository, which has all the instructions to run artifacts manually. 
Additionally, our artifact has been tested by a team other than the authors. 

Hence we are claiming for Artifacts Evaluated, Artifacts Available, and Results Validated badges.
