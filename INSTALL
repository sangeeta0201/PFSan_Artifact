* DOWNLOADING PREBUILT DOCKER IMAGE

   	 We have prebuilt a docker image and hosted it in the docker hub.

(1) Install docker if not already installed by following the
   	 installation documentation in this link:
   	 https://docs.docker.com/install/

	 We recommend installing Docker and evaluating our artifact on a machine with Ubuntu. Although docker can be used with
	 Windows or macOS, docker may run on top of a Linux VM.

(2) Download the prebuilt docker image by using the command:
	 
	 $ sudo docker pull sc1696/pfsan_artifact:latest

	 The docker image is roughly 1.21GB

(3) Run the docker image:

	 $ sudo docker run -it --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined sc1696/pfsan_artifact:latest
